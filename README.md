# Connectome-based Predictive Modeling of Handwriting and Reading

 

## Introduction

This repository contains data and code for the Connectome-based Predictive Modeling (CPM) analysis of individual behavior prediction based on brain functional networks. The study aims to predict handwriting speed and reading using general functional connectivity (GFC) derived from task-related and resting-state fMRI data.

 

## Main Features

- Data files for handwriting speed and reading.

- Matlab scripts for CPM analysis.

 

## Data

The data used in this study includes:

- GFC of adults (AD_GFC.mat) and children (CH_GFC.mat).

- Behavioral indicators for adults (AD_IndVar.mat) and children (CH_IndVar.mat).

- Covariates for adults (AD_Cov.mat) and children (CH_Cov.mat).

 

## Usage

- Run the analysis scripts: main.m
